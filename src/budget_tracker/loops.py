    # Loops in Python

    Loops allow you to run a block of code **multiple times** until a condition is met. In Python, the two main types are:

    - **`for` loops** ‚Üí iterate over a sequence  
    - **`while` loops** ‚Üí repeat until a condition is false  

    ---

    ## üîÅ `for` Loops

    `for` loops are used to **iterate over sequences** (lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, ranges).

    ### 1. Example with a List
    ```python
    categories = ["miscellaneous", "fast food", "utilities"]

    for category in categories:
        print(category)
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    miscellaneous
    fast food
    utilities
    ```

    ### 2. Example with a String
    ```python
    for letter in "Label":
        print(letter)
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    L
    a
    b
    e
    l
    ```

    ### 3. Using `range()`
    The `range()` function generates numbers.
    It's often used in `for` loops.

    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    ```

    üëâ `range(start, stop, step)`

    `start` ‚Üí beginning (default 0)

    `stop` ‚Üí end (exclusive)

    `step` ‚Üí increment (default 1)

    Example:
    ```python
    for i in range(2, 10, 2):
        print(i)
    ```

    Output: `2 4 6 8`

    ### 4. Iterating Over a Dictionary
    To iterate over the keys in a dictionary:

    ```python
    entry = {"Type": "Income", "Amount": 3050.21}

    for key in entry:
        print(key, ":", entry[key])
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    Type: Income
    Amount: 3050.21
    ```

    It is also possible to iterate through both the keys and values of a dictionary:

    ```python
    entry = {"Type": "Income", "Amount": 3050.21}

    for key, value in entry:
        print(key, ":", value)
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    Type: Income
    Amount: 3050.21
    ```

    ## üîÑ while Loops
    A while loop runs as long as a condition is true.

    ### Example

    ```python
    count = 0

    while count < 5:
        print("Count is:", count)
        count += 1
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    Count is: 0
    Count is: 1
    Count is: 2
    Count is: 3
    Count is: 4
    ```

    ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Beware of Infinite Loops
    If the condition never becomes false, the loop will run forever.

    ```python
    # This will run forever!
    while True:
        print("Press Ctrl+C to stop")
    ```
    **Always make sure your loop changes a variable or has a way to break.**

    ## üü¶ Controlling Loops
    - `break` ‚Üí exit the loop early
    - `continue` ‚Üí skip the rest of the current iteration and go to the next

    ### Example with `break`

    ```python
    for i in range(10):
        if i == 5:
            break
        print(i)
    ```

    Output: `0 1 2 3 4`

    ### Example with `continue`

    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        if i == 2:
            continue
        print(i)
    ```

    Output: `0 1 3 4`

    ## üîÇ Nested Loops
    You can put one loop inside another.

    ```python
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(2):
            print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    i=0, j=0
    i=0, j=1
    i=1, j=0
    i=1, j=1
    i=2, j=0
    i=2, j=1
    ```

    ## ‚úÖ Summary
    - Use `for` loops to iterate over sequences.
    - Use `while` loops to repeat while a condition is true.
    - Use `break` and `continue` to control the flow.
    - Be careful with infinite loops when using `while`.
    - Loops can be nested for complex iterations.
