# Welcome to the Budget Tracker Project Python Tutorial 🎉

Welcome! In this tutorial, we’ll learn Python by **building a real-world project** from the ground up.  
Instead of just learning syntax in isolation, we’ll apply Python concepts step by step to create something useful:  
a **fully functional Budget Tracker**.

## 🛠️ Our Development Environment: Marimo

For this project, we’ll use **[Marimo](https://marimo.io/)** as our main environment for development.  
Marimo is an interactive Python notebook designed to make coding, experimenting, and building projects easier.  
It’s similar to Jupyter but more lightweight and flexible, perfect for project-based learning.

With Marimo, we’ll be able to:

- Write and run Python code in an interactive way
- Visualize results instantly
- Organize our project into clean, reusable blocks
- Build a project that feels like a real application, not just isolated scripts

## 📌 What We’ll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have created a **Budget Tracker** that will allow you to:

- Record income and expenses
- Categorize your transactions
- View summaries of your spending
- Track your balance over time

This project will help you practice essential Python skills while building something practical you can actually use.

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

Along the way, you’ll get hands-on experience with:

- Python **data types** and **variables**
- **Control flow** (if statements, loops)
- **Functions** and reusable code
- **Data structures** (lists, dictionaries)
- **File handling** for saving and loading data
- Optional: basic **visualizations** for spending summaries

## 🧭 Learning by Doing

This is a **project-first tutorial**. That means we’ll introduce concepts right when you need them for the project.  
By applying Python immediately, you’ll not only understand the “how,” but also the “why.”

## 🎯 Final Goal

At the end of this tutorial, you’ll walk away with:

1. A solid understanding of Python basics
2. Confidence in building and running Python code in Marimo
3. A working **Budget Tracker app** you can expand with new features

👉 Let’s get started and begin coding our way to a practical, real-world Python project!
